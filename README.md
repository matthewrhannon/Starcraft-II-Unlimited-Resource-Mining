# Starcraft-II-Unlimited-Resource-Mining
A program that is able to convert any SC2 map into a money map. All minerals and gas are set to 100,000!

# Usage:
You need to use a DLL injector and a copy of Starcraft II without any of the patches (the beta
version would be ideal to use, but there is code written so it may also work with live
distribution.

If you have issues, try a different injector with the SC2MoneyMaker.dll!
Furthermore, no 64-bit support currently.

# Notes
NOTE: DO NOT BOTH RUN THE INJECTOR AND HAVE THE FOLDER LABELED "StarCraft II Beta"

OPEN AT THE SAME TIME, OR YOU WILL GET CRASH BECAUSE INJECTOR THINKS Starcraft is
actually RUNNING! (Will be fixed if more versions...)

# FURTHER NOTE: 
If you have to start a new map, or restart the one you are in, you MUST RERUN THE
INJECTOR!!! This can be done from ALT-Tabbing out of SC2 though!
Good Luck and I hope it works
